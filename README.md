# Analytical-Optimizer
Analytical Optimizer 1.0 is a python code that finds the analytical (symbolic) maximum value of a quadratic function of any number of variables boxed in linear constraints. It is an extension to linear programming and is not optimized to be used for linear objective functions.

Another important feature is that it supports having a free constant in the constraints (not more than one for this version) and returns different maximum values for different intervals of values of the constant.
The code supports parallel processing using MPI.
